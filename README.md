### **Guide**
Due to StrictMode in development build, the app is rendered twice for testing.  \
Hence, turn off (Errors) in console to properly see the result of question 1. \
**Question 1** The given data set is converted to snake_case and printed in Console. \
**Question 2** The persons are rendered in bottom of the screen. \
**Question 3** The increment, decrement, next prime decrement, and fibonacci increment is shown on the top of the screen with the buttons.
**Question 4** The styling partly uses Material UI and some custom styling.
